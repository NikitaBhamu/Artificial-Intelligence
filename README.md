## A1 :  Search
Implemented the following search algorithms :-
1. Depth First Search (DFS)
2. Breadth First Search (BFS)
3. Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
4. A* Search

Then designed the appropriate heuristics for the A* search algorithm for two different problems which are :
1. In this part the agent lives in a corner maze, where there are four dots, one in each corner. The agent’s goal is to find the shortest path through the maze such that it visits all the corners, irrespective of whether there is food present at that maze location or not.
2. This part involves solving the food clearing problem. The goal is to search for the shortest path for the Pacman to collect all the food available in the maze. Note that the solution should depend only on the agent’s state, wall placement and regular food.

## A2 : Multi-Agent Search
